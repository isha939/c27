Till now, we have learned how to make any​ independent object​ which follows the laws of Physics. 
 
But what about bodies which are joined together by some 'constraint': 
 
For example, the train coaches are attached, or two objects connected by a rope or a spring. 
 
 
We call such types of attachment a “​CONSTRAINT​”. One body is constrained or restricted in its movement by the position and movement of another body. 
The Matter.Constraint is used for specifying that a fixed distance must be maintained between two bodies (or a body and a fixed world-space position). 

There are many properties available. We are going to use these properties.
 1. length: pin joint.
 2. stiffness: To create elasticity, we can change the stiffness constraint. The value of stiffness can be 0.7 or above. If the constraint is unstable, try lowering the stiffness value and /or increasing it. 
 3. bodyA and bodyB - which is logical since constraint is going to be between two bodies. 
 
 But before that, change the 'namespace' of our Matter.Constraint to be called Constraint. 
 
We do this so that we do not have to call Matter.Constraint each time in our code. We can simply call it Constraint.
